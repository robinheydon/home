# My personal web browser home page.

This is a very simple search engine that provides a quick way to get to the
websites that I regularly visit without having to use a mouse. It allows
navigation using the keyboard by just typing in the search text and presenting
the results of that search and using the up and down keys to select an
appropriate entry and then using the enter key to jump to that website.

This uses a simple json file that is read from javascript to drive the search
engine.
